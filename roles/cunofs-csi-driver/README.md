# cunofs-csi-driver role

This role deploys the cunoFS CSI driver in an airâ€‘gapped Kubernetes cluster.
All manifests are templated locally and applied with `kubectl` so no
internet access is required once the assets have been fetched.
The chart and container images are downloaded by
`scripts/fetch_offline_assets.sh` and reference the private registry.

Set `cunofs_license_key` to provide your license string. The driver will be
installed into the namespace defined by `cunofs_namespace` (default
`cunofs-system`). Image names can be adjusted in `defaults/main.yml`.
